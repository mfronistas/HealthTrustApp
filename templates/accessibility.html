      <p>This accessibility statement applies to www.healthtrust.co.uk.
          We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:
          <ul>
            <li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
            <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
            <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
            <li>Weâ€™ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.</li>
          </ul>
